# House-Prices-Prediction-Model

#Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using Linear Regression, providing a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, feature engineering, model training, and result visualization. The project highlights the importance of EDA and data visualization in understanding the data and model performance.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle. It contains 81 features and one target variable, SalePrice. The features include various attributes of houses such as the number of rooms, year built, garage size, etc.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Histogram and KDE Plot of SalePrice
Correlation Matrix Heatmap to identify significant features
Pair Plots to visualize relationships between features
Box Plots to identify outliers and distribution across categories

#Machine Learning Techniques
Linear Regression was used to predict house prices.
Model evaluation metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (R²)

#Data Visualization Techniques
Actual vs. Predicted Prices scatter plot
Residual Plot to check errors
Feature Importance bar plot
Learning Curve to assess model performance

Results
The model achieved an R² score of [your score], indicating that [percentage]% of the variance in house prices is explained by the model. The results provide insights into the factors that most influence house prices.
